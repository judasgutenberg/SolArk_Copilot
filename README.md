This device is design to connect to the serial port of the WiFi dongle attached to a SolArk inverter.  Doing this allows it to intercept the important data (battery charge percentage, battery drain & charge wattage, load wattage, solar wattage, and grid wattage) at fine granularity (every ten seconds or so).



Since this device also has the ability to control devices, the plan is to use it to turn on a nearby Generac generator and perhaps also send signals to the SolArk inverter itself (assuming this can be done).
